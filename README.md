# Shamrock Shake Finder
Given a state, a home zipcode, and a little bit of time, this program will output a list of all shamrock shake carrying McDonald's locations.

I wanted to see if there were any McDonalds locations in my state that are carrying the Shamrock Shake. Turns out there aren't any.

## Usage:
```bash
$ python shamrockFinder.py
```

## Requirements:
- Python3
- Selenium
- Pandas
- Numpy
